There are two strategies used by salespeople to address customers' concerns.

One strategy is to point out something special about the product, which means something that outweighs the customers' concern, for example, a customer in an electronic store may think the computer shown by salesperson is expensive, at this time, the salesperson can provide information to outweigh the concern about the price by pointing out how fast the computer is, how much work it can get done in a short time. By doing this, the customer may think it's worth the price and is more likely to buy it.

The other strategy is to demonstrate something about the product, which means salesperson can use the product in front of the customer in response to a concern. Just ike the example mentioned above, if customer wonders whether the laptop is portable enough, the salesperson can address this concern by unplugging the computer, putting it into its carrying case and so on right in front of the customer. So he can demonstrate how easy it is to transport. This demonstration can help eliminate the customers' concerns.

There are two reasons why play is important for a child's development.

One reason is that play helps children feel more in control, which means kids are able to control their world of play when they play. For example, they decide which toy they're gonna play and how they're gonna play with it. They may take some building blocks and make a building out of them with no help at all. Playing gives them a sense of being in control and they don't feel so helpless.

The other reason is play contributes to healthy psychological development, which means that play gives children a safe way to explore certain urges, desires they have. For example, they want to explore what it's like to be destructive but they don't want their parents to be upset with them. By play, the probelems are solved.

There are two ways in which animals provide themselves with food.

One way is that they cultivate the food like human farmers , which means the food will growing until it's ready for them to use. For example,  the damselfish, which likes to eat special kind of food. They will provide protection from other plants so the seaweed can grow and then regrow as the damselfish eat it. For instance, if other plants grow over the seaweed block the sunlight, the damselfish will remove those plants by bitting off the parts that are too tall and the seaweed got protected.

The other way is that they take care of other animals as a source of food, which means that they protect the other animals which produce food for them. For example, some species of black ants will care for tiny insects call aphids for aphids produce a sweet liquid that ants like to eat. Ants guard the aphids from being eaten and even help raise the long aphids.
