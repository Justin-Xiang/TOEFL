I think companies should not allow their employees to send personal texts or emalils during work hours.I have two reasons for that.First,sending maight be a huge distraction for the students.For example ,they may think what they have talked with their friends  such as where to eat tonight and do not focus on the work they are doing.This is definitely not  what the manager of company expects to see. Second,it is bad for the development of the company.If one of the employees do these things,it is bound to acffect others and make it hard for them to concentrate on their career,which may lead to a vicious circle and will make the company  go downhill.
