[00:00.55][ppp]Listen to a conversation between a student and the advisor to the student newspaper.//请听一位学生与她的学生报顾问之间的一段对话。
[00:05.99][ppp]Hi, um, I'm the president of the backpacking club and?//你好，我是徒步旅行俱乐部的主席......
[00:10.55][ppp]You wanna talk about the article.//你想谈谈这篇文章。
[00:12.62][ppp]How did you know?//你是怎么知道的？
[00:13.94][ppp]Oh, we've had quite a few calls about it.//哦，我们最近已经接到了很多相关电话了。
[00:16.25][ppp]I'd imagine. I was really surprised you even don't print it because it was just, you know, really slanted.//我可以想象的到。这篇文章真的非常具有倾向性，你为什么不将这篇文章出版，我对此真的感到很惊讶。
[00:23.02][ppp]Well, that was never our intention but I can understand why you might feel that way.  You have to understand that this is a student paper. I'd like to let the reporters and editors cover the news as they see fit. I don't normally tell them who they sould or shouldn't interview, for example. That said in this case perhaps I should have gotten more involved.//好吧，这从来就不是我们的本意，但我可以理解为什么你会有这种感觉。你必须要理解，这是一篇学生论文。我希望记者和编辑能够以他们认为合适的方式报道这则新闻。例如，我通常不会告诉他们应该或不应该采访谁。也就是说，在这种情况下，也许我应该更多地参与进来。
[00:43.25][ppp]So you are gonna run a retraction then.//所以，你要撤回这个新闻。
[00:45.87][ppp]Well, what was reported wasn't erroneous but the reporter definitely should have done more work to present multiple perspectives on the issue. I pretty much took him to task about it at this morning's editorial meeting.//那么，报道的并不是错误的，但记者肯定应该做更多的工作来从多重视角看待这个问题。在今天早上的编辑会议上，我几乎是把他当成了批评的对象。
[00:58.45][ppp]How did he respond?//他是如何回应的？
[01:00.42][ppp]He basically defended his article on the grounds that the person he interviewed was like a university's dean of students, and the dean's point of view was that nonacademic club should not receive the same level of funding that the university gives to academic clubs, clubs like the Engineering Club, and the Physics Society.//基本上来说，他在为他的文章辩护，理由是他采访的人就像是大学的教导主任，而主任的观点是非学术俱乐部不应该资金等方面享有大学提供给工程俱乐部和物理学会等学术俱乐部的同等待遇。
[01:18.90][ppp]The Laker University Jazz Band was mentioned as an academic club, too.//湖人大学爵士乐队也被认为是一个学术俱乐部。
[01:24.15][ppp]Well, a lot of members are music majors.//好吧，很多成员都是音乐专业的。
[01:26.68][ppp]Well, a lot of backpacking club members are environmental science majors and I can't believe the jazz band members just sit around talking about music theory all the time. They probably jammed and performed mostly for fun I imagine.//好吧，很多徒步旅行俱乐部成员都是环境科学专业的学生，我无法相信爵士乐队成员一直都在谈论音乐理论。他们可能会陷入困境，并且我想他们可能是出于兴趣而凑在一起表演的。
[01:41.71][ppp]I see your point.//我明白你的意思。
[01:43.36][ppp]An there's nothing wrong with that. They're using what they are learning in the classroom and adding to it, and it's the same way with us. Backpacking and environmental education go hand-in-hand. Like one of our members is a graduate student and he teaches an intro to environmental science class and on our hikes he identifies interesting plants and points out watersheds and things like that.//这没什么不对的。他们正在使用他们在课堂上学到的东西来研究它，这与我们的方式相同。徒步旅行与环境教育齐头并进。就像我们其中的一位研究生成员一样，他对环境科学课程进行介绍，在他们的徒步旅行中，他认出了有趣的植物并指出了流域和类似的东西。
[02:07.66][ppp]Okay, well, the reporter who wrote Monday's piece is already working on a follow-up story. He is out there right now getting responses to the dean's remarks but that doesn't preclude us from also running an opinion piece on the editorial page, an opinion piece written by someone like you, someone with strong feelings and good argument. Interested?//好吧，那位写周一文章的记者已经在撰写一个后续故事了。他现在正在那里获取对主任评论的回应，但这并不妨碍我们在社论版上刊登一篇评论文章，一篇像你这样有着强烈感情和好的论点的人写出来的评论文章。你对此感兴趣吗？
[02:28.26][ppp]Oh, I don't know about that. I've never done anything like that.//哦，我不知道。我从来没有做过那样的事情。
[02:32.58][ppp]All you'd need to do is reiterate what you told me and be sure to backup your opinions with anecdotes and facts, like the member of backpacking club members who major in environmental science and how that graduate student you mentioned takes the lead on your hikes. The editor can always polish your prose as necessary.//你需要做的就是重申你刚刚告诉我的内容，并确保用轶事和事实来支持你的观点，比如主修环境科学的徒步旅行俱乐部成员，以及你提到的那个研究生如何带领你们进行徒步旅行。编辑可以在必要时对你的文章进行润色。
[02:52.76][ppp]Hum, how about if I talk to that reporter instead?//嗯，不如我去和那个记者谈谈?
[02:56.59][ppp]Um, okay. That should work, too. Why donn't you give me your contact info and I can pass it along when he comes in.//嗯，好的。这应该也有效。你可以将你的联系方式留给我，这个记者来的时候我把你的联系方式告诉他。
