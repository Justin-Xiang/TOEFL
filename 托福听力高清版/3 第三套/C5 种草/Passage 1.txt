 Listening Passage 1

Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his chemistry professor.
Professor
You want to do what?
Student
Grow grass.
Professor
Grow grass? I thought you were doing your research project on fuel derived from organic materials, biofuel.
Student
Oh, I am. But I was doing some reading. And I found out that in the process of making biofuel, there is a lot of leftover material after processing the corn or sugar or whatever into fuel. And most of those byproducts are just wasted, all the way to landfills. So I was thinking maybe I could work on some sort of project that finds use for one of the byproducts and I picked glycerol.
Professor
But there are lots of industrial uses for glycerol already. It is a common ingredient in soap and some food product.
Student
I know, but with more and more biofuel being produced, there's more glycerol being made and then used.
Professor
And so you want to work on alternative applications for glycerol, like using it to help grass grow?
Student
Yeah. There is this idea I read about. It said you could make a film, a really sticky film, that you could put on grass seed, so they stick to the ground and that would give them more time to germinate.	
Professor
This sounds a lot more complicated than the kinds of projects I suggested that your class try to do. This is more like a graduate research project.
Student
I know it's a big leap, but I can handle it.
Professor
how are you going to get the equipment you need?
Student
Actually that's why I was hoping that you could help me with that. Is there any way that I can use one of the labs in Hazelton Hall?
Professor
Those labs are only for professors doing research And once in a while graduate students are allowed to pursue a project in there.

Student
You know Hazelton's the only place that set up where we can grow lots of plants under controlled conditions is indoors. And I am gonna need some real space. I'm gonna grow grass.
Professor
Why don't you just work on developing that stick film? I'm not requiring students to field test any new substances they develop.
Student
Yeah, but I really want to know if it works. Maybe you could sponsor my research. I realized that this is supposed to be an independent project and I wouldn't actually ask you to do anything. But just think of all the possibilities. 1 keep reading that biofuel is a way of the future, which is great, but not if it produces a lot of waste byproducts. So if can find a new use for even one of them, then I'm not just doing some abstract student project. 
Professor
Well, it's nice to see you are passionate about this. Look, I can't say I'm involved in your research if i'm not. But let me see if I can get you access to Hazelton anyway. But please don't get your hopes up, okay?
