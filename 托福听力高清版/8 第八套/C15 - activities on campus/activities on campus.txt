Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the student affairs office.
Employee 
OK there, Susan?
Student 
Fine. Mr. Harris.
Employee
Congratulations on your election. President, Huh? 
Student
Thanks. You know I've been on the student activity's boards since my first few years so I thought I try for a leadership role in it.
Employee
Yeah, good. You have a lot of experience in planning events on campus.
Student
Yeah. But I've always been involved in smaller projects. As president I'm gonna be responsible for campus wide events. It's gonna be challenging, but a lot of fun, too.
Employee
Yes. That's the spirit.
Student
So, I have an idea. I’d like to book the Jimmy Smith Band to come. I think that will be a great show out on campus.
Employee
Well. If you can convince the band to come here.
 Student
Turns out they’re doing a show in Central University in a couple of months, so they'll be in the area. 
Employee 
Hum.
Student
And someone said that Jimmy Smith himself graduated from here a few years back so I bet we could book them.
Employee 
Are you a fan?
Student
To be honest, I haven't heard them. I don't think they're well-known around here, but I found out that they sound similar to the Magic Tones. 
Employee
Yep. They played here last year, right?
Student
Yeah. They were a hit. Well, they're popular. So I'm not exactly sure what I need to, well, what I need
to do to like get funded.
Employee
Well it can be a lengthy process. First, you need to come up with a budget. You figure out how much it will actually cost and fill out an application form to request a funding. And you submit the form to me, to this office that is and the funding board will go over and let me know their decision.
Student
Aha.
Employee
And if the budget is approved then depending on how highly anticipated costs will be, I may send it to the office of the dean for another approval. Then you can go ahead and try to book the band. 
Student
Urn, I have heard a rumor that funds are a little low right now?
Employee
That's right. You know that most events on campus are funded by the student activity fee including the tuition bill and normally there are enough funds available, but the costs for last year's community outreach day were much higher than expected.
Student
But we could arrange some type of fundraiser, right? Like a car wash?
Employee
You could. But in the amount of money you’d make, especially given the cost of cleaning supplies, you might be disappointed.
Student
Now well, do you have any suggestions?
Employee
Well, you might consider an auction. You could obtain items from local businesses to sell them for the highest bidder. They probably won't mind donating items since it's a free advertising. My colleague at another university told me about a student group there that made quite a bit of money from an auction fundraiser.
Student
Yeah. That's a good idea. I just need to know how to get started. Can I have your colleague's number? 
Employee 
No problem.
