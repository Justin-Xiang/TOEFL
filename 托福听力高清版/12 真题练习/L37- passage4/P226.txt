[00:00.00][ppp]Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class. The professor has been discussing a Native American tradition called the potlatch.//请听人类学课上的一段内容。教授一直在讨论一种叫做“冬季赠礼节”的印第安传统习俗。
[00:08.95][ppp]So when we ended our last class, we just started to look at the tradition of the potlatch. Can anyone remind us what that is?//所以上一堂课结束的时候，我们了解了一些“冬季赠礼节”的传统习俗。有谁能告诉我们那是什么吗？
[00:16.40][ppp]Well, it was a Native American event of one group. The host of the potlatch give away food, blankets, copper, or other items of alue to their guests in substantial quantities.//嗯，这是印第安人一个部落的活动。“冬季赠礼节”的主人们大量赠送食物，毯子，铜币或其他物品给他们的客人。
[00:26.94][ppp]And?//还有什么？
[00:28.03][ppp]In return, the host group got prestige and honor, which, well basically the higher the value of the goods, the more honor they got.//作为回报，主人们赢得了声望和尊敬，基本上来说，商品的价值越高，他们获得的尊敬就越多。
[00:35.28][ppp]Precisely. Thanks. Now we originally viewed the function of the potlatch as being social ceremonial. Why?//非常正确。谢谢。起初我们将“冬季赠礼节”视为社交礼仪。这是为什么呢？ 
[00:42.87]Because during the potlatch, important events were commemorated. //？因为在“冬季赠礼节”期间，人们会纪念一些重要的事件。
[00:46.43]For example the naming of a child, or a marriage, or the introduction of a new leader. //例如，孩子的起名，婚姻，或是介绍一位新领导人。
[00:51.75]However, recent research has shown that that's not the complete picture. //然而，最近的研究表明，这不是“冬季赠礼节”所有的作用。
[00:56.56]Another major function of the potlatch was actually conflict management. //“冬季赠礼节”的另一个主要功能实际上是冲突处理。
[01:01.40]So let's consider some features of the potlatch that made it an effective means of preventing conflict. //因此，让我们考虑一下“冬季赠礼节”的一些特点，以促使其成为预防冲突的有效手段。
[01:08.09]Take the Tlingit people for example. //以特林吉特人为例。
[01:10.80]The Tlingit inhabited the northwest coast of North America, and were one of many Native American groups there that held potlatches. //特林吉特人居住在北美西北海岸，是当地举行“冬季赠礼节”的许多美洲原住民群体之一。
[01:18.59]First of all, at least three clans were required to be present at all playing potlatches. //首先，至少有三个氏族的人参加聚会。
[01:24.26]The host clan and two guest clans. //东道主部落和两个受邀部族。
[01:26.37]The visiting clan acted as witnesses to societal changes in the host clan. //来访的部落充当了东道主部落社会变迁的见证人。
[01:32.16]For the host clan, it was a public acknowledgment and a public record of these changes that went beyond the authority of an individual clan. //对于东道主来说，这是公开承认和记录这些变化，超出了个别部落的权威。
[01:40.58]This helped prevent conflict within the host clan because its members were accountable to the other clans. //这有助于防止东道主部落内部的冲突，因为其成员需要对其他部族负责。
[01:47.23]Secondly, roles in the potlatch were predetermined. //其次，“冬季赠礼节”中的角色是预先确定的。
[01:51.00]Like, the spokesperson for the potlatch was the chief of the host clan. //就像，“冬季赠礼节”的发言人是东道主部落的首领。
[01:55.14]The chief decided such things as the order of the songs and dances performed and also the order of the speakers. //首领决定了歌曲和舞蹈的顺序，以及发言者的顺序。
[02:02.03]Another key role was played by the chief's brothers-in-law. //另一个关键角色是首领的姐夫或妹夫。
[02:05.55]They served as mediators for any problems that arose between the clans during potlatches. //在“冬季赠礼节”期间，他们充当了部落间矛盾的调解员。
[02:11.16]And this was certainly effective because the brothers-in-law were tied to more than one clan by marriage.//这当然是一种有效的手段，因为姐夫或妹夫通过婚姻与不止一个部落联系在一起。   
[02:17.17][ppp]So they had an understanding of and a personal investment in both sides.//所以他们对部落双方都有了解和个人投入。
[02:22.05][ppp]That's right. Now, a third way potlatches prevented conflict was the redistribution of wealth as a result of the one-sided giftgiving. //那就对了。现在，“冬季赠礼节”阻止冲突的第三种方式是由于单方面的礼品赠送而导致的财富再分配。
[02:30.95]A clan that was doing particularly well could afford to share its resources. // 一个表现特别好的部落可以分享其资源。
[02:35.30]It hosted the potlatch and the guest clans receive the resources. //该部落举办了“冬季赠礼节”和受邀部落接收了资源。
[02:39.29]Now when fortunes changes when another clan had a good year, they would host and the wealth would flow in a different direction. //现在，当另一个部落大丰收，财富发生变化时，他们将会举办“冬季赠礼节”，并且财富会流向不同的方向。
[02:46.34]Another important point is that there was no private ownership of community buildings in Tlingit society. //另一个很重要的一点是，特林吉特部落社区建筑物并非私人所有。
[02:52.59]Community buildings were built by members of other clans and payment to the builders for their assistance was ceremoniously provided during the potlatch //在“冬季赠礼节”期间，社区建筑物是由其他部族的成员建造的，并且在施工期间隆重地向建筑商支付了他们的援助费用。
[03:01.82][ppp]The individual clans, um, they didn’t build their own community houses?//个别部落没有建立它们自己的社区建筑吗？
[03:06.26][ppp] "Weren’t allowed to" is a better way to put it. // 可以将 “不被允许”视为一种更好的方式。
[03:08.70]This was established by clans in law, a matter of fact. //事实上，这是按着部落立定的。
[03:12.37]To me, this is an unusually effective and well thought-out practice, because it conferred two advantages. //对我而言，这是一种非常有效且经过深思熟虑的做法，因为它有两个优点。
[03:18.47]In fact it encouraged an ongoing alliance that was based on labor and it also guaranteed that no individual within the host lan could claim that they personally owned the houses.//事实上，它鼓励建立一个以劳动力为基础的持续联盟，同时也保证了东道主部落内的任何个人都不能声称他们个人拥有这些房屋。
[03:28.90][ppp]Um, Professor, you mentioned that claims became public records at potlatches. How did that work?//嗯，教授，你提到索赔已成为了“冬季赠礼节”的公共记录。那是怎么回事？
[03:34.18][ppp]That's a really good question. Since Tlingit language did not have a written system, it was only oral. //这是一个非常好的问题。由于特林吉特人语言没有文字系统，所以只是口头的语言。
[03:41.02]So let's consider the claims to specific properties as an example. //因此，让我们以特定属性的声明为例。
[03:44.98]These claims were presented in the form of stories, songs, dances or dramas. //这些声明以故事，歌曲，舞蹈或戏剧的形式呈现出来。
[03:50.20]The information presented in the performance had to be very detailed and accurate to serve as evidence in support of the speaker's authenticity. //演出中提供的信息必须非常详细和准确，以作为支持演讲者所述真实性的证据。
[03:58.09]The performance, well it actually, became the property deed.//实际上，这种表现成了财产契约。
[04:01.70][end]
