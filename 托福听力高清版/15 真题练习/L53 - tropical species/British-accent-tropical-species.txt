[00:03.45][ppp]One of the most noticeable differences between polar regions and tropical regions is the tropical ecosystems are much more diverse in terms of the plants and animals we find there.//极地地区和热带地区之间最明显的一个差异就是，热带生态系统在植物和动物方面比我们所了解的更具多样化。
[00:13.80]Now, remember that the farther you are from the equator, the more seasonal fluctuations in temperature there tend to be. So how do you think this affects animals in polar ecosystems in terms of food? John?//现在，请记住，距离赤道越远，温度的季节性波动就越大。那么约翰你认为，从食物的角度而言，这会对极地生态系统中的动物产生什么影响呢？
[00:25.55]I would guess that with big changes in seasons and you know, plants dying and animals migrating in the fall, it keeps changing what kinds of foods are available in polar regions.//我猜想，随着季节的变化，秋天的植物凋零和动物迁徙，极地地区的食物种类也在不断变化。
[00:38.54]Right and with that, the feeding behavior of polar animals. //对此，极地动物的摄食行为。
[00:43.00]They tend to cover a lot of territory in search of food and they need to be what we call, generalists, meaning that in their eating habits they’re amazingly flexible. //动物们倾向于在大片领地上寻找食物，需要成为我们所谓的杂食性动物，这意味着它们的饮食习惯非常灵活。
[00:52.12]A really good example is the Arctic Fox. It mainly eats smaller mammals.//北极狐就是一个很好的例子。它主要以较小的哺乳动物为食。
[00:56.79]Like mice and rabbits?//例如老鼠和兔子？
[00:58.61]Well yea, that’s the idea; very small mammals of that sort, but in the summer its diet expands to include migratory birds and especially their eggs, as well as insects and even berries. //嗯，是的，就是这样；非常小型的哺乳动物，但是到了夏天，北极狐的食物扩大到了候鸟，尤其是候鸟的卵，以及昆虫和浆果。
[01:10.58]It also feeds on seals or anything else that polar bears have killed and left behind, so the Arctic Fox’s definitely a generalist that’s pretty hard to categorize according to one particular type of food. //北极狐还以海豹或其他任何北极熊已经杀死并留下的食物为食，因此北极狐绝对是一个杂食性动物，很难以某种特殊的食物进行分类。
[01:22.74]Now, in the tropics, temperatures are much more stable, so what does that mean to animals in ecosystems there? Ann?//现在，热带地区的气温更加稳定，所以安，这对生态系统中的动物有何意义呢？
[01:29.28]Well, with temperatures about the same year round, their food sources would probably be much more stable too, so they wouldn’t have to keep adapting their feeding behavior to changing conditions.//嗯，在全年温度大致相同的情况下，这些动物的食物来源也可能更稳定，所以它们不必继续调整其摄食行为，以适应不断变化的环境条件。
[01:39.62]Right and typically these animals survive quite well on just one or two food sources. They’ve become what we call specialists; living in one small part of the habitat, feeding on one particular kind of food.//对，通常这些动物只靠一到两种食物便能生存。它们就是我们所谓的专食性动物；它们生活在一小块栖息地上，以一种特定的食物为食。
[01:53.42]There’s a South American bird for example called the Yellow Eared Parrot that lives in Colombia, not far from the equator. //例如，有一种南美洲的鸟叫黄耳鹦鹉，生活在距离赤道不远的哥伦比亚。
[01:59.50]It’s mostly green actually, but with patches of yellow feathers on the sides of its head near its ears.//事实上，这种鹦鹉全身大部分是绿色的，但在它的头部和耳朵附近有黄色的羽毛。
[02:04.98]Anyway, this yellow-eared parrot nests in one particular species of palm tree: the wax palm and it’s very picky about what it eats, mainly the fruit of the wax palm.//无论如何，这种黄耳鹦鹉会在一种特殊的棕榈树——蜡棕榈中筑巢，它对于食物非常挑剔，主要以蜡棕榈的果实为食。 
[02:15.92]But you said there’s more diversity in tropical ecosystems. I mean just because an animal prefers one special kind of food. Why does that lead to more diversity?//但是，您刚刚说热带生态系统更具多样性。我的意思是，动物喜欢某种特殊的食物，为什么会导致该生态系统更具多样性？ 
[02:25.05]Good question. What happens is that in the tropics with each species more or less specializing in a particular type of food, they’re more likely to divide up the ecological resources, so each little bit of the habitat essentially becomes a microhabitat that supports the species uniquely suited to thrive on the food and in the living space that this microhabitat provides. //好问题。原因在于在热带地区，每个物种或多或少地仅以某种特定类型的食物为食，它们更可能会分割生态资源。
[02:47.56]So in the {inaudible) ecosystem, you end up with lots of microhabitats and lots of different species that are not competing with each other much at all. There’s a place for everyone.//所以，基本上栖息地的每一小块区域都变成了一个微生境，这种微生境会为不同的物种提供适合其生存所需的独特食物和独一无二的生活空间。所以在（听不清）生态系统中，最终会有众多微生境和不同的物种，这些物种之间根本不存在相互竞争。每个人都有一个栖息地。
[02:57.70]So the generalist species cover a lot of territory, but the specialists?//所以，杂食性动物的捕食范围很大，那么专食性动物呢？
[03:02.57]Unlike the generalists, they don’t need to. Ok, now here’s a question to consider. //与杂食性动物不同，它们不需要很大的捕食范围。好，现在考虑一个问题。
[03:08.45]Based on what we’ve been saying, in which kind of ecosystem, polar or tropical, would you expect species to have a better chance of survival?//基于我们刚刚一直在讨论的话题，在哪种生态系统，极地生态系统还是热带生态系统，你预计动物们会有机会生存下来？ 
[03:17.17]I’d say an animal species would have a better chance of surviving in the tropics.//我认为动物物种在热带地区的生存几率更大。
[03:22.65]Because…//因为什么......
[03:24.27]Well, if they each have their own little microhabitat with no competition for food or whatever, they’ve got it made.//嗯，如果每个动物都有自己的小微生境，那么它们可以不通过竞争，便得到食物或其他东西。
[03:32.38]Right, that’s what you might think, except there is a downside to being a specialist. Can anyone think of what that might be?//是的，这是你所想到的。另外，专食性动物有一个缺点，谁能想到那可能是什么？
[03:40.70]Well, {inaudible) like you said: if they each have their own microhabitat, but what if that microhabitat disappears? Professor: Keep going...//嗯，（听不清）就像您说的那样：如果它们都有自己的微生境，那么一旦其微生境消失了，要怎么办？教授：继续说......
[03:47.87]Well, if they can eat only one kind of food and that food grows in only one particular microhabitat, well if that microhabitat disappears, they’re out of luck. They might all starve and the species could die out.//嗯，如果它们只以一种食物为食，而且这种食物只在某种特定的微生境中生长，那么一旦这种微生境消失，这种动物便会遭灾。它们可能都饿死了，物种就会灭绝。
[03:59.84]Right, extinction is a real threat and species on the brink of extinction, lots of these live in tropical regions and they’re most specialists whose microhabitat is being destroyed, often due to human activities. //没错，对于许多动物来说，灭绝是确实是一种威胁，物种处于濒临灭绝的边缘，这些动物大多都生活在热带地区，且大多数属于专食性动物。通常，由于人类活动，其微生境正在遭受破坏。
[04:14.04]This was certainly true of the yellow-eared parrot, less so now that the wax palms are legally protected, but it’s definitely something to think about.//对于黄耳鹦鹉来说，情况确实如此，现在蜡棕榈受到了法律的保护，但这绝对是一个值得思考的问题。
