[00:02.20][ppp]Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.//请听环境科学课上的一段内容。
[00:06.45]It's hard to predict how successful a conservation project will be. Many early efforts to reestablish extinct or nearly extinct species have been unsuccessful. //很难预测保护项目有多么成功。早期许多重建已灭绝或近乎灭绝的物种的努力都没有获得成功。
[00:15.78]This is especially true for insects. We now know that extincion rates for insects are much higher than those for other animals, or even plants. //昆虫的重建工作尤是如此。我们现在知道昆虫的灭绝率远高于其他动物以及植物的灭绝率。
[00:24.71]There are a couple of reasons for this. Insects reacts rapidly to the environmental change. And they tend to rely on specific interactions with other species, much more than other animals do. //这种现象有几个原因。昆虫对环境变化迅速做出反应。而且他们倾向于依赖与其他物种的特殊相互作用，其依赖程度远远超过其他动物。
[00:36.27]So their survival depends on the survival of the whole ecosystem ,and this is something that we are much more aware of today. //因此，他们的生存取决于整个生态系统的生存，这是我们今天更加了解的事情。
[00:43.36]Let's look at a specific example, the large blue butterfly. Populations of large blues are found throughout the European mainland. //让我们看一个具体的例子，大蓝蝴蝶。整个欧洲大陆地区都有大量的大蓝蝴蝶。
[00:52.49]And they were fairly common in southern England until about 100 years ago. But by the end of the 1800,  conservationists were concerned that they were disappearing ,basically on account of overly zealous butterfly collectors.//在大约100年前，大蓝蝴蝶在英格兰南部已经相当普遍了。但到了19世纪末，环境保护主义者担心这些蝴蝶正在消失，主要是因为过度狂热的蝴蝶收藏者。
[01:05.27] Butterfly collecting was a popular hobby. So in the 1930s, collecting large blues was banned in certain areas ,but populations continued to decline. //蝶收集是一种非常流行的业余爱好。所以在20世纪30年代，某些地区禁止收集大蓝蝴蝶，但其数量仍在继续下降。
[01:15.00]Over the next 40 years nine separate grassland sites were declared conservation areas, but nothing seemed to slow the butterflies’ extinction. And that really puzzled biologists. //在接下来的40年里，九个独立的草原成为保护区，但似乎没有什么方法能够减缓蝴蝶的灭绝。这让生物学家感到非常困惑。
[01:26.16] See there are a couple of things they knew about these butterflies. First they knew that young large blue butterflies ,like to feed on the flower of the thyme plant. //他们对这些蝴蝶有一些了解。首先，他们知道幼小的大蓝蝴蝶喜欢以百里香植物的花朵为食。
[01:36.30]That’s THYME. And second ,they knew that the caterpillars also spent months living underground in ants’ nest. //这就是百里香。其次，他们还知道毛毛虫在蚂蚁巢里住了几个月的时间。
[01:44.20]living with ants? how bizarre! Is this one of those what you call it, mutualistic type relationships, that they both benefit from, somehow. //和蚂蚁住在一起？多奇怪啊！这是你所谓的共生型关系之一，它们都以某种方式从中受益。
[01:54.14]No actually quite the opposite. See when the large blue caterpillar hatches, it eats thyme flowers for a few days, then it dropped to the ground ,and after that it has to survive off of it and of grabs. //实际上恰恰相反。当大蓝色毛毛虫孵化，它在几天内以百里香的花朵为食，然后掉到地上，之后它必须让自己生存下来。
[02:06.72]So it actually tricks these ants by secreting a fluid and by singing to them. It makes them think it's their queen. The ants take the caterpillar home for the winter and it has all the food it needs to become a butterfly.//所以实际上，它是通过分泌液体和鸣叫来欺骗这些蚂蚁。这让他们认为这是他们的女王。蚂蚁把毛毛虫带回家过冬，它们拥有成为蝴蝶所需的所有食物。
[02:18.27]Wow.//哇。
[02:19.49]Anyway researchers would go out to this nature reserves. See plenty of time flowers and ants, but no butterflies. And they couldn't figure out why. //无论如何，研究人员会去这个自然保护区。在大量的时间里他们只发现了花和蚂蚁，没有发现蝴蝶。他们无法弄清楚原因。
[02:29.84]Many will give up that point. But a small group decided to do a more detailed study of the butterfly to see if some unsuspected aspect of their biology was responsible for the decline. //许多人会放弃这一点。但是，一组研究人员决定对蝴蝶进行一个更详细的研究，试图去了解生物学中是否存在一些未预料到的方面，导致了衰退的发生。
[02:41.60]And what they found has really changed the way we approach conservation . //他们发现的东西确实改变了我们对待保护区的方式。
[02:45.45]See, turns out there's only one type of ant that a large group could successfully fool, the M. sabuleti. And these M. sabuleti ants have certain specific requirements as well.//事实证明，只有一种类型的蚂蚁，一大群蚂蚁可以成功地遭到愚弄，即M. sabuleti。
[02:57.62] They can survive only within a very narrow range of ground temperature. And this ground temperatures only maintained when the grass is covering the area at certain length.//而这些M. sabuleti蚂蚁也有一定的特殊要求。它们只能在一个特定的地温范围内存活。
[03:07.76] In other words when they are kept short by animals grazing on them, because the grasses even a  centimeter too long, the ground will be too cool and the M. sabulet will die. And if there are no M. sabulet ants ,well, need I say more? //换句话说，当动物吃这种草的话，它们就会一直长不高，因为草即使长了一厘米，地面也会变得很冷，而且sabulet会死亡。如果没有M. sabulet蚂蚁，嗯，就无需多说了吧？
[03:23.43]So it turns out that while the researchers may have seen ants in the nature preserves ,they are not particular ants that the large blues rely on.  Why? //事实证明，虽然研究人员可能已经看到自然保护区中的蚂蚁，但它们并不是大蓝蝴蝶所依赖的那种蚂蚁。原因是什么？
[03:32.15]because during the same time period that efforts were being made to bring the large blues back ,the numbers of grazing animals in the united kingdom, sheep, cattle, wild rabbits, were also decreasing.//因为在人们努力使大蓝蝴蝶回归是时候，英国绵羊，牛，野兔等食草动物的数量也在减少。
[03:43.71] And of course the last place animals will be grazing within the special nature preserves that have been satisfied and protected. //当然，这些动物能够在特定自然保护区内吃草的最后一个地方，这些保护区已得到满足和保护。
[03:50.60] So paradoxically even though researchers thought they were doing the right thing by establishing these conservation sites, they were actually dooming their efforts to failure today.//如此矛盾的是，即使研究人员认为他们通过建立这些保护区做了正确的事情，但是实际上，判断他们的努力今天仍然会失败。
[04:00.13] Large blues have been successfully re introduced into the United Kingdom through careful management of preserves to ensure that grasses are maintained at the right length. //通过精心管理保护区，大蓝蝴蝶已成功引入英国，以确保草可以保持在一个适当的高度。
[04:09.88]And this idea of habitat management has been extended to the conservation of other insect species as well.//这种栖息地管理理念也已被推广到其他昆虫物种的保护上来。
