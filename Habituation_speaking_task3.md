Habituation  refers to a form of learning that when an animal experience a situation for the first time, particularly one  it considers threatening, it may instinctively respond by running away or by warning other members of its community with alarm calls, just like the example from the professor about prairie dogs.

In the beginning, when the animals see a human being, they'd instinctively react by making a sharp barking sound like a dog and jumping up and down. However, if people pass through the area where the animals live, the animals would stop barking and jumping up and down. So, in the end, the animals stop reacting to humans as though they were a threat.

So this example proves that through habituation the animals' natural behavior gradually changes.
