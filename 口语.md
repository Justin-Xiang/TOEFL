读一段通知或者公开信->听对话->复述观点及原因

关键是干了啥

两原因 两安排 / 一原因 一安排

阅读时要着重看原因 因为听力很有可能是来反驳这两个原因的



模版：

* The university has decided to ... because A and B (within 12s)
* (如果是公开信)(The letter suggested that ...  because A and B)
* And/But the man/woman agrees/disagrees with that for two reasons
* First,原因一(核心+支撑)  衔接语：For example;this is because 支撑句：相关人的三个动作
* Second,原因二(核心+支撑) 衔接语：For example;this is because 
* That is why he/she agrees/disagrees with the decision/proposal/letter



通过 不是...而是... 来加强说服力

如果是同意 可以用 just like the announcement points out/just as the spokesperson says
